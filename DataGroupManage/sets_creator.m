% SETS_CREATOR M-file for sets_creator.fig
%      SETS_CREATOR, by itself, creates a new SETS_CREATOR or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = SETS_CREATOR returns the handle to a new SETS_CREATOR or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      SETS_CREATOR('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in SETS_CREATOR.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      SETS_CREATOR('Property','Value',...) creates a new SETS_CREATOR or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before sets_creator_OpeningFunction gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to sets_creator_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
